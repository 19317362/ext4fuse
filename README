=== ext4fuse ===
This is a implementation of ext4 for FUSE.  A quite limited one, I should say,
but still able to mount my ubuntu 10.04 partition.  The main reason this exists
is to be able to read it from OSX.

Of course, this is only readonly, and it should be safe to use.  In the worst
case scenario you won't be able to mount anything (although I believe that
should work).  Write support is not going to come for some time: first I should
address some design issues, make some tests and get some respectable read
performance.

If you notice a problem, please fill a bug report, preferably with a logfile
attached.  You can use the github tracker:
  * http://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse/issues

You can also drop a mail.  I'd like to know if someone else is using this
besides me.
  * gerard.lledo@gmail.com

=== Usage ===
Compile using "make".  You can mount a filesystem like this:
$ ./ext4fuse /dev/sda1 mountpoint [optional-logfile]

At least on Leopard, you need to add your user to the operator group so you can
have readonly permissions to the disks.  Use this:
$ sudo dscl . append /Groups/operator GroupMembership <your-user>

=== Limitations ===
 * All code is religiously Little Endian only.  If you don't know what this
   means, you are probably OK (ie, you are using x86 or x86-64).
